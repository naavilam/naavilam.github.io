    In this work, I studied quantum information encoding mechanisms, the construction of gate-based quantum circuits, and their implementation using Cirq, Amazon Braket, and Qiskit. I analyzed the execution of quantum operations and algorithms across different quantum hardware platforms—such as superconducting, trapped-ion, photonic, and neutral-atom systems—examining execution time, noise, and decoherence parameters. I implemented algorithms such as the Deutsch algorithm and Grover’s quantum search, and carried out introductory studies in quantum machine learning using quantum support vector machines (QSVM). To address noise in NISQ devices, I explored quantum error mitigation techniques, including zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) and Clifford-based regression methods.

- name: Quantum Material Simulation
  id: project2
  description: >
    My research evolved through quantum simulations of molecular systems. I modeled electronic Hamiltonians within the Born–Oppenheimer approximation and expressed fermionic Hamiltonians through second quantization, mapping them to qubit representations using the Jordan–Wigner transformation. I performed ground-state energy calculations in hybrid quantum–classical architectures using variational methods, implementing the UCCSD ansatz with Qiskit Nature and conducting comparative experiments with PennyLane on simple molecular systems. Building on this variational framework, I explored neural-network quantum states—specifically restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs)—as expressive ansätze for representing molecular ground states.

- name: Heavy Ion Collision
  id: project3
  description: >
   This project investigates relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider using a model–to-data comparison framework. The work focuses on training statistical emulators to reproduce the output of computationally intensive theoretical models, avoiding the need to run full dynamical simulations. These emulators are then used to study correlations between experimental observables and physical parameters—such as shear and bulk viscosity, rapidity, transverse momentum spectra, among others—allowing an assessment of how different observables constrain the underlying collision dynamics.
