    My work in quantum computing focuses on gate-based quantum algorithms and circuit implementation using Cirq, Amazon Braket, and Qiskit. It includes quantum information encoding through amplitude and phase, foundational algorithms such as the Deutsch algorithm and quantum search, and introductory studies in quantum machine learning, including quantum support vector machines (QSVM). I also analyzed the execution of quantum operations across superconducting, trapped-ion, photonic, and neutral-atom hardware platforms, comparing execution time and hardware-specific characteristics. To address hardware noise, I studied quantum error-mitigation techniques, including Clifford regression and zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE).

- name: Quantum Material Simulation
  id: project2
  description: >
    My research evolved through quantum simulations of molecular systems. I modeled electronic Hamiltonians within the Born–Oppenheimer approximation and expressed fermionic Hamiltonians through second quantization, mapping them to qubit representations using the Jordan–Wigner transformation. I performed ground-state energy calculations in hybrid quantum–classical architectures using variational methods, implementing the UCCSD ansatz with Qiskit Nature and conducting comparative experiments with PennyLane on simple molecular systems. Building on this variational framework, I explored neural-network quantum states—specifically restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs)—as expressive ansätze for representing molecular ground states.

   This project explores relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider through a model–to-data comparison approach. The work focuses on training statistical emulators to reproduce the behavior of complex theoretical models without explicitly running their full dynamical simulations. Using these emulators, the project investigates correlations between different experimental observables, such as particle yields, collective flow, and fluctuations, with the goal of understanding how each observable constrains the underlying collision dynamics and physical parameters.
