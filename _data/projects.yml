    My work in quantum computing spans the main conceptual and practical pillars of the field, including quantum information encoding through amplitude and phase, the construction of gate-based quantum circuits, and their implementation using Cirq, Amazon Braket, and Qiskit. I have analyzed the execution of quantum operations and algorithms across different quantum hardware platforms—such as superconducting, trapped-ion, photonic, and neutral-atom systems—examining execution time and hardware-specific characteristics. This work includes the study and implementation of foundational quantum algorithms, such as the Deutsch algorithm and quantum search, as well as introductory approaches to quantum machine learning, including quantum support vector machines (QSVM).

    My research evolved through quantum simulations of molecular systems. I modeled electronic Hamiltonians within the Born–Oppenheimer approximation and expressed fermionic Hamiltonians through second quantization, mapping them to qubit representations using the Jordan–Wigner transformation. I performed ground-state energy calculations in hybrid quantum–classical architectures using variational methods, implementing the UCCSD ansatz with Qiskit Nature and conducting comparative experiments with PennyLane on simple molecular systems. Building on this variational framework, I explored neural-network quantum states—specifically restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs)—as expressive ansätze for representing molecular ground states.
